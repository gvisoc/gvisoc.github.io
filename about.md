Welcome!

My name is Gabriel, I am Spanish and I live in Sydney since 2017.

This is my site at GitHub Pages, where I *intend* to write a little about technology, the internet, Podcasting, Architecture and software Engineering. Also how those affect society, sometimes. Note the verb "*intend*": its use is totally intentional.

* You can follow me on twitter if you can read Spanish [in my account, gvisoc](https://twitter.com/gvisoc). Sometimes I tweet something in English but, to tell the truth, that happens very few times.
* If you understand spoken Spanish you might want to listen to my podcast (about moving to Australia) in [australiando](https://australiando.es). It is [also in iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/es/podcast/australiando/id1219755027?mt=2) for you to listen to it using whatever your favourite podcast player was.
* You can find me also at GitHub (kind warning --my repo is mostly empty!) where I'm also [gvisoc](https://github.com/gvisoc)

You can also check other ways to contact me through my [keybase profile](https://keybase.io/gvisoc).
