Welcome!

My name is Gabriel, I am a Software Architect from Spain, and I live in Sydney since 2017.

This is my personal website, hosted at GitHub Pages. Here I write about tecnology, privacy and minimalism.

- You can follow me on Mastodon at [@gabriel@fedi.gvisoc.com](https://fedi.gvisoc.com/@gabriel). I tweet both in English and in Spanish.
- You can find me also at GitHub where I am also [gvisoc](https://github.com/gvisoc).

Looking forward to hearing from you!
