Welcome!

My name is Gabriel, I am a Software Architect from Spain, and I live in Sydney since 2017.

This is my personal website, hosted at GitHub Pages. Here I write about tecnology, privacy and minimalism.

- You can follow me on twitter at [gvisoc](https://twitter.com/gvisoc). I tweet both in English and in Spanish. To tell the truth, most of my tweets are in Spanish. I am trying to improve that balance and tweet more in English.
- You can find me also at GitHub (kind warning --my repo is mostly empty!) where I am also [gvisoc](https://github.com/gvisoc).

Looking forward to hearing from you!
