Welcome!

My name is Gabriel, I am Spanish and I live in Sydney since 2017.

This is my site at GitHub Pages, where I *intend* to write a little about technology, how I work, the internet, Podcasting, (IT) Architecture and Software Engineering. Also about how those affect society, sometimes, specially in how people should embrace security practices in their digital life.

Also, moving to Australia has simplified a lot my life, as I had to sell or let go almost all my material possessions. That meant a lot of changes in my habits, and recently I realised that I evolved into a minimalist in many aspects of my life, in a 100% natural way, as I said, beginning with my move to the Down Under. Regarding this transformation, you can expect some posts about decluttering, work patterns, how simplifying my stuff led to much more focus, etc.

* You can follow me on twitter if you can read Spanish [in my account, gvisoc](https://twitter.com/gvisoc). Sometimes I tweet something in English but, to tell the truth, that still happens less times than I would like.
* You can find me also at GitHub (kind warning --my repo is mostly empty!) where I'm also [gvisoc](https://github.com/gvisoc)

You can also check other ways to contact me through my [keybase profile](https://keybase.io/gvisoc).
