I"#<p>It’s been a while since I started this website in 2018, using a very simple setup with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. I haven’t used it very much, namely I’ve written 4 posts in these, almost, 2 years. Indeed, the previous post is exactly one year old today! I’m back to it because I miss a space in where I can share my thoughts on a subject, my conclusions after some specific chain of events, studies, experiments or personal projects (if they don’t die after a few weeks, which is often the case). Or if I have a position on something on the news, or if <em>I just want to share content</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t promise that I will post more often, what I’m saying is that this will be the place for them. Also this is not a new year’s resolution, it’s just the conclusion of a series of events that made me turn back to personal websites instead of just having social media profiles.</p>

<p>This post is about some thoughts about websites, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
