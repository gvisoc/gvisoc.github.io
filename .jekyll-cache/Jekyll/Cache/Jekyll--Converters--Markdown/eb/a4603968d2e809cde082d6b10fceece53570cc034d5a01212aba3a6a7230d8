I"Ş<p>Those of you who follow me on Anchor, or who listen to my Spanish-spoken podcast â€œ<a href="https://anchor.fm/gvisoc">Sobre la marcha</a>â€ may have listened to a bunch of episodes about personal finance, <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">You Need a Budget</a> (YNAB) and budgets in general. In this post I want to share some notes with those of you that you havenâ€™t listened to that, either because you donâ€™t understand Spanish or because whatever reason.</p>
