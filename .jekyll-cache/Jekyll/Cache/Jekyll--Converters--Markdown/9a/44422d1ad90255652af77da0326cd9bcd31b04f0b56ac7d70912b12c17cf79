I"±<p>Itâ€™s been a while since I decided to get a new laptop and, finally, the replacement to my MacBook Pro mid-2014 came in the mail last Monday (April 21st, 2020). The selected laptop has been a Lenovo ThinkPad T490s, and I decided to use it entirely with Linux.</p>

<p>In this post I will link some power management tweaks and explain them, as well as some other tips and resources, and analyse how this laptop battery performs using Ubuntu 20.04.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR â€“ Too Long; Didnâ€™t Read</strong></p>

<p>The battery life of this integrated GPU laptop can comfortably last a whole 9 to 5 day for a developer-like job, with CPU demand peaks here and there, like building binaries and running automated tests. That kind of usage also includes browsing static documentation and not very fancy sites like Stack Overflow connected to a WiFi, and streaming music to a bluetooth headset to get in the flow.</p>

<p>When it comes to browser-based jobs, like online publishing or editing, the battery life can drop a bit but I still believe that it can make the day if we are not too much into graphics and animation-oriented web publishing.</p>

<p>We have to be careful about the choices we make with regards to the browser we use, and take some precautions against parasitic browser code like tracking and advertising. These things are draining our battery and making our laptop work for someone else, and thatâ€™s definitely something to avoid.</p>
