I"\<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>My name is Gabriel, I am Spanish and I live in Sydney since 2017.</p>

<p>This is my personal website, hosted at GitHub Pages. Here I <em>intend</em> to write a little about technology, how I work, the internet, Podcasting, (IT) Architecture and Software Engineering. Also about how those affect society, sometimes, specially in how people should embrace security practices in their digital life.</p>

<p>Also, moving to Australia has simplified a lot my life, as I had to sell or let go almost all my material possessions. That meant a lot of changes in my habits, and recently I realised that I evolved into a minimalist in many aspects of my life, in a 100% natural way. Regarding this transformation, you can expect some posts about decluttering, work patterns, how simplifying my stuff led to much more focus, etc.</p>

  <li>You can follow me on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/gvisoc">gvisoc</a>. I tweet both in English and in Spanish. To tell the truth, most of my tweets are in Spanish. I am trying to improve that balance and tweet more in English.</li>
  <li>You can find me also at GitHub (kind warning â€“my repo is mostly empty!) where I am also <a href="https://github.com/gvisoc">gvisoc</a></li>
