As of 10/05/2021, this site is absolutely free of cookies. There is no tracking of you whatsoever.

![No cookies! Yay!](/assets/no-cookies.png)

The only cookie that this blog has had since I removed the comments system (it was a tracking beast!) was Clouldflare's `__cfduid`. [They have deprecated it on May 10th](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/).

If you want to know more about how this site is done, and where is it hosted, check [this previous blog post](https://gvisoc.com/this%20site/personal/2020/01/04/This-Site-is-Still-Up-And-Running.html). 

*TL;DR: Jekyll on GitHub Pages and no comments, no third party plugins or social integrations.*
