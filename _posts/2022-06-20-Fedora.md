Quick post for what the title says: I've moved to Fedora a couple of releases ago (34). I had been using Debian for almost 10 years, and recently I had moved to Manjaro for about a year, or so.

The reason is the need or convenience of having more recent versions in the packages than in Debian, and an increased stability when compared to Manjaro. 

What drove me away from Manjaro were the dangers of using AUR, which is a week ahead of the distribution packages; installing an end-user application from AUR can pull system-level dependencies from it, catastrophically breaking the system. I find Fedora to have a collection of software wide enough for me to stay within the provided repositories and the RPM-Fusion ones. On the other side, Fedora supports Flatpak well enough for those missing ones, and *as far as I understand*, the RPM packaging system handles the depedencies in a way that prevents those breakages from happening.

My three Raspberry Pi units remain in Raspberry Pi OS for now (the 64-bit variant).
