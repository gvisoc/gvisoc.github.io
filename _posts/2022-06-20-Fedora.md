Quick update(*) I've moved to Fedora a couple of releases ago (34). I had been using Debian for almost 10 years, and recently I had moved to Manjaro for about a year, or so.

The reason is the need or convenience of having more recent versions in the packages than in Debian, and an increased stability when compared to Manjaro. It services my tasks perfectly well, it doesn't get in the way, and it seems it will be staying around my computers for a while.

My three Raspberry Pi units remain in Raspberry Pi OS for now (the 64-bit variant).

(*): I recently removed a couple of uninteresting posts and this one is probably a brief substitution of those.
