I am not going to relate all my trajectory on Mastodon because I want to make things shorter. 

The idea is that Mastodon is an application with non-trivial machine requirements, and **the Cloud is Expensive**.

## Mastodon is Heavy
Let's see where Mastodon's footprint comes from, from my very limited understanding of things and my limited experience:

 - Mastodon is a Ruby on Rails application that has *at least* three independent processes, or services as shown in `systemd`: 
   - The web application, that offers a user-facing applicaton where the user has to interact with in order for the application to fetch information.
   - The streaming API, which does things in the background and streams things to the clients, both web and mobile.
   - The Sidekiq worker, which runs in the background and implements the federation, or so I believe, in the sense of replicating data in and out of our instance to the other known instances.[^1]
 - It depends also on a Postgresql database.
 - It uses Redis, an in-memory cache backed into the disk, to support Sidekiq processes.
 - It uses *A Lot* of disk space, as a result of the users' activity and uploaded media, but also as a result of the federated content coming from other instances.[^2]
 - You will need several other smaller services hanging around, like an NGINX to act as a web server and gateway.

In my experience, in a Digital Ocean Droplet of 2GB RAM and 2 CPU Mastodon will have to be stopped for you to be able to run maintenance tasks without Digital Ocean killing them; 4 GB and 2 CPU will be the minimum suitable one. A disk space of less than 60 GB will be tight.

And that's just a minimal installation. Add HA (High Availablity) on those components, and you'll have to put much more hardware and extra networking services. 

Therefore, the beast is heavy.

## The Cloud is Expensive
One of the aforementioned droplets would cost you US$24 a month, which in Australian dollars is about A$40/month. 

That's a lot of money; $#%@ A$480 a year. And the droplet is a dumb and isolated virtual machine that doesn't do *anything* for you with regards to maintenance and administration.

- Do you want application backups? They are charged separately.
- Do you want machine snapshots? They are charged separately.
- Do you want alerting when the droplet is down or slow? Charged separately.
- Are you running things in HA? Do you need extra network things on top of the droplets you're adding? Charged separately! 

And, of course: your labour. You must keep not only Mastodon, but also the underlying operating system up to date and finely tuned. That's a lot of work, on top of being a lot of money.

## What it Takes
Here's the thing. 
- In 2 months, you would have spent more money than the cost of an ARM single board computer, like the Raspberry Pi[^3], that exceeds the aforementioned requirements (Model 4B, 4GB --4 core) *plus the electricity cost of running it*. 
- In another 2-3 months, you can add to the pack an SSD drive of 500 GB to 1 TB, and externalise all the disk usage to it.
- From there, you are effectively saving a lot of money that you could use to support the projects around the network, or the instances you sympathise with.

The only things that you need are: 
- As said, a small computer with enough resources
  - 4 GB of RAM, 60 GB or more of storage, 4 core is enough to get you up and running.
  - In the medium term, if you're using an SD card for the system, attach some proper storage for high I/O load for performance and reliability. Small SSD and USB 3.0 cases for them are very cheap.
  - ðŸŒ± Preferably, choose a low power device (ARM for example). Don't run Mastodon 24/7 on your gaming PC ðŸŒ·
- A domain managed by a domain provider that supports DDNS[^4], 
- Install `ddclient` (from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient)) on your machine, 
- A router that supports NAT and that allow you to expose services at ports `80` and `443`.[^5]
- A decent internet connection.[^6] 

It obviously won't support more than a few friends and family members. But if your instance is personal, or one of those cases, the amount of extra work that you need to do by having the instance at home, compared to having it in a provider like Digital Ocean, is negligible. 

And it's **heaps cheaper**.

[^1]: A federated application is not a distributed application. While in a distributed application all instances try to discover all other instances and be able to communicate with each other, a federated one is passive. Only if the instances know each other they will communicate. How an instance can know other instances? In Activity Pub, only through the users' actions. If I decide to follow you at https://mastodon.social from my https://fedi.gvisoc.com, then those two instances will begin talking to each other. From that moment, they talk **a lot**, but the federation details are out of the scope of this article. Just let's assume that there is a lot of media files and data going back and forth without us needing to do anything other than start following each other.
[^2]: Mastodon caches a lot of information, including (and especially) pictures and videos from other instances. For all the known instances' followed accounts and all the known but unfollowed accounts, such as those accounts whose posts you see because someone you follow boosted one of their posts. From all those, it will cache avatars, headers, emojos, and all the attachments of the posts that are *visible* in your timelines. Visible doesn't mean viewed. Those resources will be cached in your instance's disk even if you never see them. And I'm sure this doesn't end there, but I am not 100% sure of all the implications of the federation and ActivityPub.
[^3]: Although [the people around the Raspberry Pi is not very popular at the moment](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrisstokelwalker/raspberry-pi-hired-ex-cop-mastodon-controversy), the community around these machines is huge and I'm sure many of us will find some at the bottom of a drawer.
[^4]: I am having them at Cloudflare, who are ethically very slow and tone deaf as well (please suit yourself with a web search engine for this one claim), but very cheap. And in the free tier of Cloudflare, you can update the DNS record for your Raspberry Pi through their API, which is understood by `ddclient`.
[^5]: I haven't found any router that wouldn't allow you to do so. Even the provided by the ISP (I am using one of those right now).
[^6]: I am getting very good results with an internet connection that offers 20 Mbps upload speed. This includes not only me accessing information on the go, but also the other instances to find my information quickly: there are posts that are reacted almost immediately, after me publishing them.
