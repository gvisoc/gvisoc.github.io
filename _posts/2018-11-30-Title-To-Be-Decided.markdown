I've been using Twitter for about 11 years, since September 2007. Through all this time I have been quite neat in my approach to maintain my timeline clean of both bullshit and (human-generated) garbage as hathred; my timeline is useful, inspiring and valuable to me. Thanks to that curation Twitter has been, by far, my best source of news and a very useful way to stay connected to many matters, as technology and security, and to many social movements.

But lately I realised that I had developed a mechanic habit of browsing twitter blindlessly, mindlessly and meaninglessly, almost as an act of reflex.
