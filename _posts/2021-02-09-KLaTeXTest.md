This is a text of \\(\KaTeX\\), a way to render $$\LaTeX$$ in a Jekyll blog. It has inline code (as previously shown), but also block code:

\\[
    \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\\]

Check this [source](https://cullaloe.com/render-latex-in-jekyll/), or [the project home page](https://katex.org), to check it out!
