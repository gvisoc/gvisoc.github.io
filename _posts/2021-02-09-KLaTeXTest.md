This is a test of \\(\KaTeX\\), a way to render $$\LaTeX$$ in a Jekyll blog. It supports inline code, as in the previous sentence, and also block code as shown below.

$$
    \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

Visit this [blog post by Nick Hood](https://cullaloe.com/render-latex-in-jekyll/) or [the $$\KaTeX$$ project home page](https://katex.org) to check it out!
